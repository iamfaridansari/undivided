          <p>
            Respected Ma'am/Sir and my dear friend. Myself Farid Ansari. I am a
            fresher in the way of pursuing my career in FrontEnd development.{" "}
            <br /> <br />
            This project is entirely made by me from scratch. The idea behind
            making this project is very constructive. We as a fresher practice
            small projects to develop our frontend skills. These small projects
            include a calculator, todo application, a quiz app, quote generator,
            using free API and many more. So I came up with an idea of binding
            all these small applications and made <b>Undivided</b> as a form of
            Single Application Program. <br /> <br />
            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React were used by me to build this project. React is the
            main ingredient for my project, as we can use it to make Single
            Application Program easily using React. My project does not include
            backend part. <br /> <br />I hope you will like it. Thank you.
